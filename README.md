# Trees and array Backtrack

As part of Data-structures course, given the implementation of a data structure, we needed to build an algorithm to "undo" the last step we did on the structure.

For example, if some node from the middle of the tree is removed, we need to retrieve the tree to its previous form. With a limitation of O(log n) for all binary trees and O(h) for B-tree by performing a single backtrack.

The algorithm was developed and written by Gal Noy and Yonatan Balassiano
